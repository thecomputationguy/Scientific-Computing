ODE Solver for Population Model:

PopulationModel() - Takes inputs, calls appropriate functions, plots results

exact() - Computes the exact value of the Population Function at each time step

euler() - Calculates the approximate solution using Euler's Method

heuns() - Calculates the approximate solution using Heun's Method

rungekutta4() - Calculates the approximate solution using the 4th Order Runge Kutta Method

error() - Computes the Global error as well as the error in each step


Just run PopulationModel.m in a matlab terminal
